1) We have app based static files Tree as
		<Project Name>
		  	-<AppName>
				-static
					-<App Name>
						-css
							-example.css

2) We have global static files Tree as
	<Project>
		-static
				-css
					-example.css

By default Django doesn't search for the global static file so we have to register in settings.py (add this line to the bottom)

import os 

STATICFILES_DIRS =[
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
]

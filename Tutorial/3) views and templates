1) in todo>views.py

	from django.shortcuts import render
	from django.http import HttpResponse
	from .models import Task
	# Create your views here.

	def index(request):
		tasks = Task.objects.all()  //tasks represents all the objects which is in general represented by name // check models
		context = {'tasks': tasks}
		return render(request,'todo/list.html',context)

2) in todo>list.html, we are now able to access the context dictionary by 'task' as

<h1>TODO APP</h1>

{% for task in tasks %}
	<div>
		<p>{{ task }}</p>
	</div>
{% endfor %}
